# Retrack

This application is used for displaying release dates as a timeline. It is originally
designed for video game or movie release dates but any event is supported.

* Anyone can create an event, timeline, or add the event to a timeline.
* Timelines are visible to everyone.
* If you are logged in, any timelines you create will also allow you to remove events.
* If you own an event, you are allowed to delete it.
* Events are not editable.
